## Background

At the recent Tech Gala in Madison, Wisconsin there was a raffle for a number of items. Sarah and I bought a total of 10 tickets and entered to win nine of the items (one ticket apparently went missing). We won five of the nine items that we tried to win.

This seemed like a very unlikely outcome so I got the data from the raffle 
organizer. Here are the items that we entered, the number of tickets we entered,
the number of total tickets that were entered, and whether or not we won:

* Pinecone 1/8 (won)  
* Card 1/2 (didn't win)  
* Candle 1/9 (didn't win)  
* Cutting boards [5 of this item were available] 1/24 (didn't win)  
* Studio class 1/21 (didn't win)  
* Gift card 1/7 (won)  
* Hammer [2 of this item were available] 1/11 (won one)  
* Stand [4 of this item were available] 1/37 (won one)  
* Cards 1/1 (won)  

## How to Use

Run the Rmd code to produce a md report that calculates the probability of the observed outcome.
